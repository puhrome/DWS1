        <dd><blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-speed_bicycle"> a single-speed bicycle is a type of bicycle with a single gear ratio. These bicycles are without derailleur gears, hub gearing or other methods for varying the gear ratio of the bicycle.</blockquote></dd>

        <dd><blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-gear_bicycle"> a fixed-gear bicycle (or fixed-wheel bicycle, commonly known as a fixie) is a that has a drivetrain with no freewheel. The freewheel was developed early in the history of bicycle design but the fixed-gear bicycle remained the standard track racing design. More recently the "fixie" has become a popular alternative among mainly urban cyclists, offering the advantages of simplicity compared with the standard multi-geared bicycle.</blockquote></dd>

        <dd><blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_bicycle">a term used to describe bicycles built for traveling at speed on paved roads. Some sources use the term to mean racing bicycle. Other sources specifically exclude racing bicycles from the definition, using the term to mean a bicycle of a similar style but built more for endurance and less the fast bursts of speed desired in a racing bicycle; as such, they usually have more gear combinations and fewer hi-tech racing features.</blockquote></dd>


        <dt><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_bicycle">Track</a></strong></dt>
        
        <dd><blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_bicycle">a track bicycle or track bike is a bicycle optimized for racing at a velodrome or outdoor track. Unlike road bicycles, the track bike is a fixed-gear bicycle; thus, it has only a single gear and has neither a freewheel nor brakes. Tires are narrow and inflated to high pressure to reduce rolling resistance. Tubular tires are most often used in track racing[1] and training, though advances in clincher tire design have seen them being used somewhat more often. </blockquote></dd>
